# Pytorch Tutorial

This repository demonstrates how pytorch can be used for the purpose of image processing. The jupyter notebooks `mnist_CNN.ipynb`,`mnist_RNN`,`mnist_LSTM.ipynb` and `mnist_GRU.ipynb` apply different neural network based methods such as Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory based RNN and Gated Recurrent Unit based RNN on the MNIST dataset to perform the image processing task.
